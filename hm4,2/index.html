          <p class="card-description">
            Luffy's superpower is his ability to stretch his limbs â€” and we're
            not talking about yoga. Made of rubber, his arms and legs give him
            an advantage in any fight

          <h2 class="card-title">Zoro</h2>
          <p class="card-description">
            Zoro is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy to be part of his
            crew of pirates, after he is rescued by Luffy from execution. Zoro
            is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant,
            though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which
            recurs as a running gag throughout the series.

            his vivre card and has almost unrivalled mastery over it. He is
